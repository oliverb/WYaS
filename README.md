# Readme
## Introduction
This is a work-in-progress implementation of the "Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours" tutorial. Many thanks go to its original author Jonathan Tang and all contributors of the current [Wikibook](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours) version.

As of now, it supports parsing and evaluation of simple expressions but knows no state of any form. In particular there are no variables yet.

## Usage
After building the executable via `cabal build` simply calling it invokes an interactive REPL:
